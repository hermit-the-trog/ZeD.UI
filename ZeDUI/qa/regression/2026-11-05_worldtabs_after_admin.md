| Started | 2026-11-05 10:21:49 |
| Finished | 2026-11-05 10:26:41 (4 min 52 s) |
| Mode | fullscreen4k (3840x2160 fullscreen) |
| Display | fullScreen=true height=2160 width=3840 |
| Game build | 42.22.1 71e8410c42 attached (version.txt) |
| Mod version | 0.1.1242300k |
| Save | Saves/Sandbox/ZeD-QA |
| Manifest | C:/Users/you/Zomboid/mods/ZeD-UI/ZeDUI/tools/qa/worldtabs_admin.txt (6 scripts) |
| Result | **5/6 pass**, 1 warn, 0 fail, 0 timeout |
| Go numbers | 20910 to 20917 |

Screenshots are in `C:/Users/you/Zomboid/Screenshots` (the next run overwrites them). PASS: reached DONE with no ERR line and no Lua error. WARN: DONE with ERR lines of its own, or the script ran twice. FAIL: ok=false, a Java exception in the script's window (with -debug the game logs one even for an error a script catches) or the game lost. TIMEOUT: no DONE in time (the run stops there). Not run: after a timeout, a paused game or a lost game. "(expect ...)" prints are shown, not checked.

## Run notes

- ZeD settings: UI scale 1.75x (4K), additions Vanilla Plus (all on, Restock Casual) (the director's ModOptions.ini kept aside)
- pzrestorewin.ps1 (before a fullscreen run): no backup
- started ProjectZomboid64.exe -debug (fullscreen, the director's options.ini)
- loaded; clicked the screen centre (1920,1080) to pass 'click to start'
- the bridge armed in game on Saves/Sandbox/ZeD-QA
- quit: quit to the main menu, then to the desktop (go 20916, 20917)
- ZeD settings: the director's ModOptions.ini put back
