# ZeD-GUI punch list

The handoff between the QA session and the build session (director, Oct 30 2026, "ZeD-GUI QA
overhaul and punch list"). QA writes findings here and never fixes them; the build session works
from it; the director sees everything and decides. The director's notes go here at any time,
even while a check is running. Nothing is dropped: an idea lands here.

Each finding: what is wrong, where, how it was found; the cause in plain words; the ways to fix
it with their trade-offs; then the director's choice. A fix waits for that choice (a "put it
back to spec" for something already locked still waits for a yes).

States: **open** (found, no choice yet), **chosen** (the director picked a fix: build may start),
**fixed** (build says done; QA to confirm), **confirmed** (QA checked it in game).

## Open

1. **Right-click broken in t12.** fixed (t13, staged Oct 30) - QA to confirm on the uploaded build.
   How it got through: no script ever right-clicked an inventory row; 19 build the menu by calling
   the game's menu code directly, so the path from the mouse to the row was never used.
2. **The radio drawer is full width; it was designed half width.** chosen (Oct 30): with item 3.
   Write every panel's designed width (half or full) where the tests can measure it in game.
   Cause (build, Oct 30): a walkie's 220 px panel, at a whole zoom plus the scrollbar, is wider
   than the half card at every scale (about 265 units at 1.75 against 220). Since the two-widths
   rule (Oct 29) a drawer is exactly half or full, so it rounds up to the full card; before, it
   opened at the walkie's own width, a third width. Choice: the walkie goes to Design with item 3,
   drawn to fill the half card at every scale (panels 154 / 180 / 206 / 257 px); it stays full
   width until then. Ordinary radios, the CD player and TVs (chosen Oct 30): their own faces from
   Design, radios and the CD player in the half card, TVs in the full card, house radios and TVs on
   the same faces. Request: `ZeDUI/REQUEST_design_radio_tv_faces_20261030.md`. Washers and dryers
   next; then the pocket watch, alarm clock, timer, remote and pager (ideas, not yet asked for).
3. **Plates at every scale (design first).** chosen (Oct 30), with Design. At 4K on 1.75 the 336
   pixel plates sit small in their cards. Rule: scale scales everything. Choice: each plate re-laid
   at four widths that fill the full card, 336 (0.75, 1.5), 392 (1.75), 450 (1.0, 2.0 and up), 562
   (1.25); the game draws the widest that fits (85-100% between the listed scales); 0.5 dropped;
   the 200 pixel narrow faces stay for Auto on 720 or 800 high screens with the smallest font.
   Request: `ZeDUI/REQUEST_design_plates_fill_20261030.md`. The test checks the right width loads
   and fills its card, crisp, at every scale.
4. **Disclosures:** every one opens and closes properly. open.
5. **Screenshots show everything open:** disclosures expanded (Foraging especially). open.
6. **Buttons:** every button clicked, its result checked; a list of every button and its expected
   result. The item card's back key: fixed in t13 (now an X); the rest open.
7. **Hover flicker:** hints and tooltips settle and hold. The window box and close box: fixed in
   t13 (their help was stamped in an update that runs every 100 ms). The ZeD style menu: open,
   cause not yet checked.
8. **Controller only:** every button and tab reachable, focus never lost or stuck. open.
9. **Keyboard:** shortcuts, Escape closes things, typing in fields doesn't trigger game keys. open.
10. **Save and reload:** settings, window positions, themes survive a restart. open.
11. **Themes:** every screen in dark, light and high contrast, no unreadable text. open.
12. **Edge cases:** empty containers, hundreds of items, long names, broken items, full items. open.
13. **Resizing:** windows at their smallest and largest. open.
14. **Errors:** no new console errors after a run. open.
15. **Performance:** no stutter opening big containers. open.
16. **Other mods:** a short run with a few popular mods on. open.
17. **Faces or simple cards (director, Oct 30).** chosen. One switch in ZeD setup, faces by default,
    for the devices shown in cards: radios, TVs, walkie-talkies, ham sets, ovens, microwaves, fryer,
    grill, generators (not the car radio, siren, dashboard or watch). Simple cards exist only for the
    radio tab today; the machines' simple cards are new. Build to write the plain rules and the
    simple cards' layout for the director before building.
18. **Every added feature can be turned off; off by default for a vanilla run (director, Oct 30).**
    open. Loadouts and the rest included; a quick switch turns them all on ("vanilla plus"). Build to
    list every addition with its switch and default, and the quick switch's rules, for the
    director's pick. Note: the Oct 26 switches (ammo on the belt, read marks, next level on skill
    books, dashboard lamps, moodle notices) were on by default; this would turn them off.

## Test process

- The release check (before every upload, about 5 minutes, pass or fail): right-click opens the
  menu, both windows open, an item moves, the controller works, the watch reads the time. Not
  built yet.
- The full pass's own problems (found in the t13 run, Oct 30): world_pad_take depends on where
  the Eraser sits in the QA character's bag; two_widths depends on the test before it leaving a
  card open; dash_green's fire truck won't pass 2 km/h at the drag strip; px_icons has a first-run
  fluke. The dashboards take 15 of the pass's 57 minutes. The QA save drifts between runs.
